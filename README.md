## What is Node.js?
Node.js is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside a web browser. It was built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and designed specifically for building scalable, high-performance network applications. Since JavaScript is traditionally used for front-end development, Node.js enables the use of JavaScript on the server side, making it possible to create full-stack applications with a unified language.
### What is Node.js Used For?
**Node.js** is widely used for a variety of applications, particularly:

1. **Web Servers and APIs:** Node.js is ideal for creating web servers and API endpoints that handle large numbers of simultaneous requests efficiently.
2. **Real-Time Applications:** Because of its event-driven, non-blocking architecture, Node.js is perfect for real-time applications like chat applications, gaming servers, and live video streaming.
3. **Microservices:** Node.js supports the development of microservices and is used extensively in cloud-native applications, making it easier to scale specific parts of an application.
4. **Command-Line Tools:** Node.js can be used to create command-line tools for automating tasks, making it a useful tool for developers.
5. **Single-Page Applications (SPAs):** The asynchronous nature of Node.js complements SPAs, allowing faster rendering of dynamic content.
